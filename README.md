# Engajobs

Engajobs is an online platform to search and publish contact information of professinals focused on diversity. It is an online catalog, containing profiles from any area, allowing people to search for location, gender, ethnicity, age etc.

If you are a freelancer and you sympathize with the LGBT+ cause, we invite you to create your profile at Engajobs!

## Architectural Overview

This project is made entirely with Ruby on Rails, following it's MVC pattern, with a PostgreSQL database and will be published on Heroku.

## Local environment

WARNING: before anything, you need to make sure you are on an Ubuntu or MacOS machine. It can be a virtual machine or a normal PC. If you are a windows user, fear not, just install WSL2 before you start coding!

To run this project locally, you will need to have installed:
- Git (install and [configure an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh), to make your life easier :) )
- ruby (3.0.0)
- rails (6.1.3.1) 
- node (v14.15.0)
- yarn (any version)
- postgresql (any version)

If you have any trouble with installing and configuring your environment, I recommend following [Le Wagon's setup guide](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/WINDOWS.md). 

After installing all dependencies, clone the repository to your PC. Then run:

```
gem update --system
bundle update
bundle install
yarn install --check-files
```
```
rbenv local 3.0.0
rails db:create && rails db:migrate && rails db:seed
```

To run the server locally, just type: 
```
rails s
```
It will tell you on wich door it is running, then you go to your browser and type `localhost:3000` or whatever number is your port.

## Unitary tests

Currently, we have not implemented unitary tests yet. 

## Configure deploying on Heroku

First, make sure you are logged in to Heroku and have the correct permissions to deploy on the app configuration.
```
heroku git:remote -a engajobs-staging
git remote rename heroku heroku-staging
```
## Test deploying on Heroku

After logging on Heroku and setting the remote, you can push your code from a local branch to the Heroku remote with this command:
```
git push heroku-staging YOUR_BRANCH_NAME_HERE:main
```
Don't forget to replace the branch name in the command above. 
This command will push your branch to the main branch in heroku. If you just want to push from Github's main to Heroku main, make sure you have pulled the most recent changes to your local main and then run:
```
git push heroku-staging main
```
